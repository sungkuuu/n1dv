Installation
Install the Onyx SDK and its peer dependencies using your preferred package manager:


Copy
pnpm add @enzymefinance/onyx-sdk
pnpm add @enzymefinance/onyx-environment @enzymefinance/onyx-abis viem
Note: @enzymefinance/onyx-environment, @enzymefinance/onyx-abis, and viem are peer dependencies that must be installed alongside the main SDK package.

Prerequisites
Node.js 18 or later

TypeScript 5.0 or later

Basic understanding of Ethereum and smart contracts

Familiarity with Viem (the underlying Ethereum client library)

Supported Networks
The Onyx SDK supports the following networks:

Ethereum Mainnet (Chain ID: 1)

Arbitrum (Chain ID: 42161)

Base (Chain ID: 8453)

Plume (Chain ID: 98866)

For deployed contract addresses on each network, see Contract Addresses.

Quick Start
Set up a Viem client to interact with the blockchain:


Copy
import { createPublicClient, createWalletClient, http, parseEventLogs } from "viem";
import { mainnet } from "viem/chains";
import { privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts";

// Public client for reading data
const publicClient = createPublicClient({
  chain: mainnet,
  transport: http(),
});

// Wallet client for sending transactions
const account = privateKeyToAccount("0x...");
const walletClient = createWalletClient({
  account,
  chain: mainnet,
  transport: http(),
});
Depositor Actions
These are the primary actions for building depositor-facing interfaces (subscriptions and redemptions).

Note: The addresses required below (deposit queue, redeem queue, shares contract) can be retrieved from the Onyx API or your vault's configuration. Similarly, after submitting a deposit or redemption request, you can retrieve your request ID either by parsing the transaction receipt events (shown below) or by querying the API for your pending requests.

Controller vs Owner: In deposit/redeem requests, controller is the address authorized to cancel the request, while owner is the address that will receive the shares (for deposits) or redeemed assets (for redemptions). These can be the same address.

Approve Tokens
Before depositing, approve the deposit queue to spend your tokens:


Copy
import * as Asset from "@enzymefinance/onyx-sdk/Asset";

// Check current allowance
const allowance = await Asset.getAllowance(publicClient, {
  asset: "0x...", // Token address (e.g., USDC)
  owner: "0x...", // Depositor address
  spender: "0x...", // Deposit queue address
});

// Approve if needed
const approveTransaction = Asset.approve({
  asset: "0x...",
  spender: "0x...", // Deposit queue address
  amount: 1000000n, // Amount to approve
});

const hash = await walletClient.writeContract(approveTransaction);

// Wait for approval to be confirmed before depositing
await publicClient.waitForTransactionReceipt({ hash });
Request Deposit
Submit a deposit request to the queue:


Copy
import * as Components from "@enzymefinance/onyx-sdk/Components";
import { ERC7540LikeDepositQueueAbi } from "@enzymefinance/onyx-abis";

const depositTransaction = Components.ERC7540LikeDepositQueue.requestDeposit({
  queueAddress: "0x...", // Deposit queue address
  amount: 1000000n, // Amount to deposit
  controller: "0x...", // Address that can cancel the request
  owner: "0x...", // Address that will receive shares
});

const hash = await walletClient.writeContract(depositTransaction);

// Get the request ID from the transaction receipt
const receipt = await publicClient.waitForTransactionReceipt({ hash });
const logs = parseEventLogs({
  abi: ERC7540LikeDepositQueueAbi,
  logs: receipt.logs,
  eventName: "DepositRequest",
});

if (logs.length === 0) {
  throw new Error("DepositRequest event not found");
}
const requestId = logs[0].args.requestId;
Cancel Deposit
Cancel a pending deposit request.

Note: A pending deposit request can only be cancelled after the queue's minimum request duration has elapsed. The contract stores a canCancelTime for each request; calling cancelDeposit before that time reverts with MinRequestDurationNotElapsed. Check whether a request is cancellable by fetching it with getDepositRequest and comparing canCancelTime to the current block timestamp.


Copy
const cancelTransaction = Components.ERC7540LikeDepositQueue.cancelDeposit({
  queueAddress: "0x...",
  requestId: 1n, // ID of the deposit request
});

const hash = await walletClient.writeContract(cancelTransaction);
Check Deposit Status
Query the status of a deposit request:


Copy
const depositRequest = await Components.ERC7540LikeDepositQueue.getDepositRequest(
  publicClient,
  {
    queueAddress: "0x...",
    requestId: 1n,
  },
);
Request Redemption
Submit a redemption request:


Copy
import { ERC7540LikeRedeemQueueAbi } from "@enzymefinance/onyx-abis";

const redeemTransaction = Components.ERC7540LikeRedeemQueue.requestRedeem({
  queueAddress: "0x...", // Redeem queue address
  amount: 1000000000000000000n, // Amount of shares to redeem
  controller: "0x...", // Address that can cancel the request
  owner: "0x...", // Address that will receive the redeemed assets
});

const hash = await walletClient.writeContract(redeemTransaction);

// Get the request ID from the transaction receipt
const receipt = await publicClient.waitForTransactionReceipt({ hash });
const logs = parseEventLogs({
  abi: ERC7540LikeRedeemQueueAbi,
  logs: receipt.logs,
  eventName: "RedeemRequest",
});

if (logs.length === 0) {
  throw new Error("RedeemRequest event not found");
}
const requestId = logs[0].args.requestId;
Cancel Redemption
Cancel a pending redemption request.

Note: A pending redemption request can only be cancelled after the queue's minimum request duration has elapsed. The contract stores a canCancelTime for each request; calling cancelRedeem before that time reverts with MinRequestDurationNotElapsed. Check whether a request is cancellable by fetching it with getRedeemRequest and comparing canCancelTime to the current block timestamp.


Copy
const cancelTransaction = Components.ERC7540LikeRedeemQueue.cancelRedeem({
  queueAddress: "0x...",
  requestId: 1n,
});

const hash = await walletClient.writeContract(cancelTransaction);
Check Redemption Status
Query the status of a redemption request:


Copy
const redeemRequest = await Components.ERC7540LikeRedeemQueue.getRedeemRequest(
  publicClient,
  {
    queueAddress: "0x...",
    requestId: 1n,
  },
);
Read Share Balance and Price
Query fund share information:


Copy
import * as Shares from "@enzymefinance/onyx-sdk/Shares";

// Get user's share balance
const balance = await Asset.getBalanceOf(publicClient, {
  owner: "0x...", // User address
  asset: "0x...", // Shares contract address
});

// Get current share price
const sharePrice = await Shares.sharePrice(publicClient, {
  sharesAddress: "0x...", // Shares contract address
});

// Get total supply
const totalSupply = await Asset.getTotalSupply(publicClient, {
  asset: "0x...", // Shares contract address
});
Admin Actions
These actions are for vault admins to configure and administer funds.

Get Network Environment
Use the environment package to get deployment addresses and configurations:


Copy
import {
  Network,
  getEnvironmentGroup,
  Deployment,
} from "@enzymefinance/onyx-environment";

// Get the environment for Ethereum mainnet
const environmentGroup = getEnvironmentGroup(Deployment.ETHEREUM);
const environment = environmentGroup.getEnvironment();

// Access deployed contract addresses
const globalAddress = environment.contracts.global.address;
Execute Deposit Requests
Process pending deposit requests:


Copy
const executeTransaction = Components.ERC7540LikeDepositQueue.executeDepositRequests({
  queueAddress: "0x...",
  requestIds: [1n, 2n, 3n], // IDs of requests to execute
});

const hash = await walletClient.writeContract(executeTransaction);
Execute Redemption Requests
Process pending redemption requests:


Copy
const executeTransaction = Components.ERC7540LikeRedeemQueue.executeRedeemRequests({
  queueAddress: "0x...",
  requestIds: [1n, 2n],
});

const hash = await walletClient.writeContract(executeTransaction);
Configure Fees
Set up fund fees:


Copy
// Set entrance fee
const entranceFeeTransaction = Components.FeeHandler.setEntranceFee({
  feeHandlerAddress: "0x...",
  feeBps: 50, // 0.5%
  recipient: "0x...",
});

// Set management fee rate
const managementFeeTransaction = Components.ContinuousFlatRateManagementFeeTracker.setRate({
  tracker: "0x...",
  feeBps: 200, // 2% annual
});

// Set performance fee rate
const performanceFeeTransaction = Components.ContinuousFlatRatePerformanceFeeTracker.setRate({
  tracker: "0x...",
  feeBps: 2000, // 20%
});
Manage Deposit Allowlist
Control who can deposit:


Copy
// Add address to allowlist
const addTransaction = Components.ERC7540LikeDepositQueue.addAllowedController({
  queueAddress: "0x...",
  allowedControllerAddress: "0x...",
});

// Remove address from allowlist
const removeTransaction = Components.ERC7540LikeDepositQueue.removeAllowedController({
  queueAddress: "0x...",
  allowedControllerAddress: "0x...",
});

// Set deposit restriction mode
const { DepositRestriction } = Components.ERC7540LikeDepositQueue;
const restrictionTransaction = Components.ERC7540LikeDepositQueue.setDepositRestriction({
  queueAddress: "0x...",
  depositRestriction: DepositRestriction.ControllerAllowlist, // or DepositRestriction.None
});
Update Valuations
Update asset prices and share value:


Copy
const updateTransaction = Components.ValuationHandler.setAssetRatesThenUpdateShareValue({
  valuationHandlerAddress: "0x...",
  assetRateInput: [
    {
      asset: "0x...", // Asset address
      rate: 1000000n, // Price in value asset terms
      expiry: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 3600, // Rate expiry timestamp
    },
  ],
  untrackedPositionsValue: 0n, // Value of any untracked positions
});

const hash = await walletClient.writeContract(updateTransaction);
TypeScript Support
The SDK is built with TypeScript and provides full type safety:


Copy
import type { Address } from "viem";
import * as Asset from "@enzymefinance/onyx-sdk/Asset";
import * as Components from "@enzymefinance/onyx-sdk/Components";

// All addresses are typed
const asset: Address = "0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48";
const owner: Address = "0x...";

// Function parameters are fully typed
const tx = Components.ERC7540LikeDepositQueue.requestDeposit({
  queueAddress: "0x..." as Address,
  amount: 1000000n,
  controller: owner,
  owner: owner,
});
Common Patterns
Transaction Simulation
Before sending transactions, simulate them to catch errors:


Copy
const transaction = Asset.approve({
  asset: "0x...",
  spender: "0x...",
  amount: 1000000n,
});

// Simulate first
const { result } = await publicClient.simulateContract(transaction);

// Then execute
const hash = await walletClient.writeContract(transaction);
Batch Operations
Use Promise.all for multiple read operations:


Copy
const [balance, allowance, sharePrice] = await Promise.all([
  Asset.getBalanceOf(publicClient, { owner: "0x...", asset: "0x..." }),
  Asset.getAllowance(publicClient, {
    owner: "0x...",
    spender: "0x...",
    asset: "0x...",
  }),
  Shares.sharePrice(publicClient, { sharesAddress: "0x..." }),
]);
